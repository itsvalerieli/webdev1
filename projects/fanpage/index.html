            <h3>Realistic Combat Simulation</h3>
            <p>The game is about realism. Killing 100 enemies with only a pistol is not possible. You will be challenged by highly intelligent AI that is capable of advanced tactical maneuvers such as flanking, surrounding and even fake retreating, almost like what you would experience in real combat. Only carefully planned tactics, equipment, and cooperation between squads can bring you victory. Are you up to the challenge?
