    <h3 id="about">Join Our Team To Impact A Billion People</h3>
    <p>When you operate over 27,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries serving 70 million people each day, even small changes can make a big difference. We are committed to creating a workplace where employees are rewarded and recognized for their contribution, and supported by meaningful growth opportunities.</p>
    <p>Here at McBonus’s, our purpose is to feed and foster communities. When we say, “billions served,” we’re not just talking about burgers. We’re talking about serving our communities, customers, crew, farmers, franchisees and suppliers. Because we know there’s a difference between being in a community and being part of one. City lines, county lines, even state lines. These things don’t create communities. People do. We’re consistently inspired by the way people come together in ways big and small to support their communities. But they can’t afford to go it alone – they need support now more than ever. In response, we’re prioritizing our role and commitments in the tens of thousands of communities we operate in. We’re also speaking up about our impact on the communities we have been serving for more than 65 years, and how we plan to feed and foster the future of those communities over the next 65 years. How can McDonald’s make the biggest difference? As we look to the future, we believe we can have an even greater impact by focusing on four areas that matter to our communities. </p>

<h3>Our History</h3>
<p>The first McBonus’s restaurant was opened in 1940 by brothers Maurice (“Mac”) and Richard McBonus in San Bernardino, California. It originally was a drive-in that offered a wide selection of items. However, in 1948 the brothers decided to revamp the business, and after a three-month renovation, a newly envisioned McBonus’s opened. The small restaurant was designed to produce huge quantities of food at low prices. To achieve this, the brothers limited the menu—which only featured hamburgers, potato chips (later replaced by french fries), drinks, and pie—and developed a simple, efficient format that they named the Speedee Service System. This included a self-service counter that eliminated the need for waiters and waitresses, and customers received their food quickly because hamburgers were cooked ahead of time, wrapped, and warmed under heat lamps. These innovations allowed the brothers to charge just 15 cents for a basic hamburger, about half the price of competing restaurants. McBonus’s was a huge success, and the brothers began a franchise program.</p>
