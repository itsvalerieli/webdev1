<h3>Our Values</h3>
    <ul>
        <li style="color:#ffbb00";>Serve</li>
        <p>We Put Our Customers and People First. Every decision we make as an organization considers, â€œWhat does this mean for all of our customers and people?"</p>
        <li style="color:#ffbb00";>Inclusion</li>
        <p>We Open Our Doors to Everyone. We want people to feel welcomed and supported in bringing their authentic selves to our restaurants and offices.</p>
        <li style="color:#ffbb00";>Integrity</li>
        <p>We Do the Right Thing. We consider the impact of every decision we make as a company so we can stand by them with confidence.</p>
        <li style="color:#ffbb00";>Community</li>
        <p>We Are Good Neighbors. In addition to many global initiatives, the majority of our restaurants are run by independent franchisees who influence and serve their local communities.</p>
        <li style="color:#ffbb00";>Family</li>
        <p>We Get Better Together. With the three-legged stool - company staff, franchisees and supplier - we know none of us is as good as all of us.</p>
